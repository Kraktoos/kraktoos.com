import Logo from "../../../components/Logo.astro";

Aight so I've spent the last week getting cozy with <Logo src="endeavouros" alt="EndeavourOS logo" /> [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), and I have to say: it's been a delight.

Coming from a history of distro-hopping that includes:

- <Logo src="fedora" alt="Fedora logo" /> [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) for
  the past year.
- <Logo src="linuxmint" alt="Linux Mint logo" /> [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
  the year before that.
- <Logo src="popos" alt="Pop!_OS logo" /> [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) for
  another month or so.
- <Logo src="ubuntu" alt="Ubuntu logo" /> [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) on my servers
  for as long as I can remember.

I've never encountered such a user-friendly distro. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting that beginners should dive straight into EndeavourOS, but if you've already got the Linux basics down, this distro is a complete gem!

EndeavourOS is essentially Arch but with a good installer.

Installing software is as easy as hitting <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (yes, I'm an i3 user) and typing

```bash
yay fuzzy-name-of-app
```

Pick the number that better matches your desired package/script, and voil√†, it just installs like magic. I've heard of people talking about the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) as if it's something magical and now I finally see why. I am yet to want to install something that's not either on the official/extra repos, the AUR or in a Flatpak in Flathub.

Also, coming Fedora, I am used to `dnf` being really quite slow (now being fixed with `dnf5`, but still) so using `pacman` is a breath of fresh air.

EndeavourOS has been really plug & play. I haven't experienced any major glitches or encountered weird issues that forced me to delve into a rabbit hole of old threads for minutes or even hours yet.

Everything has just... worked... really.

Also, I do want to install something like Artix manually some day, and I think getting used to EndeavourOS is a good starting point for that.
