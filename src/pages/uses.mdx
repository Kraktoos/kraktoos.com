## Basics

### OS/Distro

I daily drive <Logo src="endeavouros" alt="EndeavourOS logo"/> [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/). It's fast, and it's basically <Logo src="archlinux" alt="Arch Linux logo"/> [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) on easy mode.

### Window Manager

<Logo src="i3wm" alt="i3wm logo" /> [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/). I've used forever
now and absolutely love it.

### Web Browser

<Logo src="firefox" alt="Firefox logo" /> [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
with the [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) user.js (a mixture
of improvements to Firefox's privacy, security and speed (and some other QoL
things)). As per extensions, I use a **ton** of them, but the most notable ones
are:

- <Logo src="ublockorigin" alt="uBlockOrigin logo" /> [uBlock
  Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to
  block ads, trackers and other annoyances (like cookie notices)
- <Logo src="darkreader" alt="DarkReader logo" /> [Dark
  Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) to get
  dark mode everywhere
- <Logo src="bitwarden" alt="Bitwarden logo" /> [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
  as my [password manager](#password-manager)

### Text Editor

<Logo src="neovim" alt="Neovim logo" /> [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) or <Logo
  src="vscode"
  alt="Visual Studio Code logo"
/> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), depending on the
project.

### Terminal

<Logo src="alacritty" alt="Alacritty logo" /> [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
with <Logo src="bash" alt="Bash logo" /> [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
At some point I might try <Logo src="zsh" alt="Zsh logo" /> [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/),
but as of now, I don't need it. I also use <Logo src="tmux" alt="Tmux logo" /> [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
to keep terminal sessions and
[powerline-shell](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell) to make my terminal
look fancy.

## Utilities

### File Manager

<Logo src="thunar" alt="Thunar logo" /> [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start)
or [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) (if I want to look fancy). I don't
really need anything too complex, I just have to be able to browse my files
effectively.

### Video Player

<Logo src="mpv" alt="mpv logo" /> [mpv](https://mpv.io/). You guessed it! It's
free, open-source, fast, and I mean, it's mpv.

---

## Productivity

### Image Manipulation

<Logo src="gimp" alt="GIMP logo" /> [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). Once again:
It's free, open-source and has all the features I need.

### Video Editing

I haven't really been editing many videos but when I did, I used <Logo src="vegaspro" alt="VEGAS Pro logo"/> [VEGAS Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/en/vegas-pro/) (on Windows) and more recently <Logo src="davinciresolve" alt="Davinci Resolve logo"/> [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/), which works on Linux.

### Audio Editing

<Logo src="tenacity" alt="Tenacity logo" /> [Tenacity](https://tenacityaudio.org/)
because Audacity started to ship with telemetry. It's free, open-source and has
all the features I need.

### Office Suite

<Logo src="libreoffice" alt="Libreoffice logo" /> [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
or <Logo src="microsoftoffice" alt="Microsoft Office logo" /> [Microsoft
Office](https://www.office.com/) (on Windows).

## Online Services

### Password Manager

<Logo src="bitwarden" alt="Bitwarden logo" /> [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
It's free, open-source and, as of now (02/2023), trustworthy enough for me. I
**have** used KeePass and other apps that support KeePass formats, and they're
fine, but I need to access my passwords outside my main devices.

### Email

<Logo src="tutanota" alt="Tutanota logo" /> [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/).
Not very feature rich, but it's really cheap, end-to-end encrypted, green and
has its clients open-source.

### VPS

<Logo src="hetzner" alt="Hetzner logo" /> [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/).
It's where I'm hosting this website, a Minecraft server, and others. They're
cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### Domains

<Logo src="namecheap" alt="Namecheap logo" /> [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them.
They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### DNS Management

<Logo src="cloudflare" alt="Cloudflare logo" /> [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them.
They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.
