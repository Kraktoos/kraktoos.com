			<h3>Hey! I'm Kraktoos ðŸ‘‹</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a high school student currently studying at <a href="https://colgaia.pt">ColÃ©gio de Gaia</a> where I'm learning about general programming, OOP, databases, productivity applications as well as some hardware.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love tech, programming, Linux, open-source and privacy. I'm currently learning about web development.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past I've worked on a few projects, mainly in Visual Basic, C# (both for school), as well as Python and some other languages here and there.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can find me over on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kraktoos">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kraktoos">Twitter</a> as well as on <a href="https://github.com/kraktoos">GitHub</a> and in most places of the internet @kraktoos.
