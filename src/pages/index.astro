      <p>
        I'm a Portuguese high school student and tech enthusiast currently studying at <a href="https://www.colgaia.pt">ColÃ©gio de Gaia</a> where I've been learning about general programming, OOP, databases, productivity apps and hardware.
      </p>
      <p>I'm into Tech, Programming, Linux, Free Software and Privacy and I'm currently learning about web development.</p>
      <p>In the past, I've worked on a few projects, mainly in C# (mainly for school), Python, JavaScript and some other languages here and there.</p>
